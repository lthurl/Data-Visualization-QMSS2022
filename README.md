# Data-Visualization-QMSS2022
This repo contains the assignments and projects from the QMSS data visualization class 


## **Assignment 1**
### Winter Olympics

Imagine you are the data scientist at a respected media outlet -- say the "New York Times". For the Winter Olympics coverage, your editor-in-chief asks you to analyze some data on the history of `Winter Olympics Medals by Year, Country, Event and Gender` and prepare some data visualizations in which you outline the main patterns around which to base the story.

Since there is **no way that all features of the data can be represented** in such a memo, feel free to pick and choose some patterns that would make for a good story -- outlining important patterns and presenting them in a visually pleasing way. 

Provide **polished plots** that are refined enough to include in the magazine with very little further manipulation (already include variable descriptions [if necessary for understanding], titles, source [e.g. "International Olympic Committee"], right color etc.) and are understandable to the average reader of the "New York Times". The design does not need to be NYTimes-like. Just be consistent.


## **Assignment 2**
### AirBnB

Explore the key variables of AirBnB use, the locations of AirBnB places, and some (potential) indications on how it impacts the rental market.
**1. Overall Location**

a) Provide a map to show where in New York City AirBnB listings are located.

b) Provide a map in which you summarize the density of the AirBnB listings and highlight the hot-spots for AirBnB locations. Make sure to annotate a few hot-spots on the map.

**2. Renting out your apartment vs. permanent rentals**

a) Choose a combination of both maps and non-mapping visualizations (graphs or tables) to explore where in NYC listings are available sporadically vs. year-round. Make sure to highlight the neighborhoods were most listings appear to be permanent or semi-permanent rentals.

b) Some hosts (identified by host_id) operate multiple rentals. Provide a data table of the the top hosts, the total number of listings they are associated with, the average nightly price, and the estimated average monthly total income from these listings.

**3. Top Reviewed Rentals**

Provide an interactive map which shows the Top 100 most expensive and Top 100 best reviewed rentals in NYC.

## **Assignment 3** *To be Uploaded*
### Kickstarter

Kickstarter is an American public-benefit corporation based in Brooklyn, New York, that maintains a global crowd funding platform focused on creativity.  The company's stated mission is to "help bring creative projects to life". 

Kickstarter has reportedly received almost $6 billion in pledges from 20 million backers to fund more than 200,000 creative projects, such as films, music, stage shows, comics, journalism, video games, technology and food-related projects.

For this assignment, I am asking you to analyze the descriptions of kickstarter projects to identify commonalities of successful (and unsuccessful projects) using the text mining techniques we covered in the past two lectures.
